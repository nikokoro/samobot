# Samobot

WIP Discord bot to fetch Housamo data on units, banners, etc.

## Basic development guide

Clone this repo, run `npm i`, and set your Discord bot token to the
`DBOT_TOKEN` environment variable (make a `.env` file with a line that says
`DBOT_TOKEN=yourtokenhere`). Run server with `npm start`.

Testing suite is still WIP at the moment.
